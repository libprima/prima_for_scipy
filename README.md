### What

**This is a partial copy of [PRIMA](http://www.libprima.net). As of March 11, 2023, it includes only
the Fortran version of PRIMA.**
See the [PRIMA](https://github.com/libprima/prima) repository for the full PRIMA project.

PRIMA provides the reference implementation for Powell's renowned derivative-free optimization methods,
namely COBYLA, UOBYQA, NEWUOA, BOBYQA, and LINCOA. The "P" in the name stands for
[**P**owell](https://www.zhangzk.net/powell.html), and "RIMA" is an acronym for
"**R**eference **I**mplementation with **M**odernization and **A**melioration".

PRIMA is part of a research project funded by the
[Hong Kong Research Grants Council](https://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/rgc) and
the [Department of Applied Mathematics](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama) (AMA) at the
[Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk) (PolyU).
It is still **under intensive development**.
The current version is ready to be [used in MATLAB](https://github.com/libprima/prima/blob/main/README_mat.txt).
If you want to use the above-mentioned methods in Python, see the [website](https://www.pdfo.net)
and [repository](https://github.com/pdfo/pdfo) of [PDFO](https://www.pdfo.net) instead
([Py-BOBYQA](https://numericalalgorithmsgroup.github.io/pybobyqa/) is also highly recommended if
you intend to solve bound-constrained problems).

PRIMA was initiated by [Zaikun Zhang](https://www.zhangzk.net) in July 2020, based on
the [PDFO](https://www.pdfo.net) package by [Tom M. Ragonneau](https://tomragonneau.com/) and Zaikun Zhang.


### Why

Professor Powell carefully implemented his derivative-free optimization methods into publicly available solvers,
which are genuine masterpieces. They are widely used by engineers and scientists. For instance,
see Section 1 of [a recent paper on Powell's solvers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13246.pdf)
as well as the Google searches of [COBYLA](https://www.google.com/search?q=cobyla)
and [BOBYQA](https://www.google.com/search?q=bobyqa).

However, Professor Powell's implementation was in [Fortran 77](./fortran/original)
and the code is nontrivial to understand or maintain, let alone extend.
For many practitioners, this has become an obstacle to exploiting these solvers in their
applications. Even worse, it has hindered researchers from exploring the wealth left by Professor
Powell to us.

Before he passed, Professor Powell had asked me and
[Professor Nick Gould](https://www.numerical.rl.ac.uk/people/nimg) to maintain his solvers.
This is an honorable mission. To make the solvers more accessible, I started PRIMA.
It is a project somehow similar to the translation, interpretation, and annotation of Euclid’s
*Elements*. It will make Powell's solvers easily understandable to everyone, not only the experts.
Few people remember [who translated *Elements*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements#Translations),
but it is a job that must be done.

PRIMA aims to provide the reference implementation of Powell's methods in modern languages,
including [**modern** Fortran](https://fortran-lang.org) (F2008 or newer), MATLAB, Python, C++, and
probably Julia and R. It will be a faithful implementation, in the sense that the code will be
mathematically equivalent to Powell’s, except for the
[bug fixes](#bug-fixes) and [improvements](#improvements) made intentionally.

The focus is to implement these methods in a **structured** and **modularized** way so that they
are easily **understandable**, **maintainable**, **extendable**, **fault tolerant**, and **future proof**.
The code will **have no GOTO** (of course)
and will **use matrix-vector procedures instead of loops** whenever possible.
In doing so, PRIMA codes the algorithms **in a way that we would present them on a blackboard**.
Such an implementation will enable us to get a deeper understanding of Powell's methods and
pave the way for new developments based on them.

There do exist "translations" of Powell's Fortran 77 code into other languages. For example,
[NLopt](https://github.com/stevengj/nlopt) contains a C version of COBYLA, NEWUOA, and BOBYQA,
but the C code in NLopt is translated from the Fortran 77 code straightforwardly, if
not automatically by [f2c](https://netlib.org/f2c/f2c.pdf), and hence inherits the style, structure,
and probably [bugs](#bug-fixes) of the original Fortran 77 implementation.
Note, however, that
[Py-BOBYQA](https://numericalalgorithmsgroup.github.io/pybobyqa/) is a **true translation** of BOBYQA
to Python, with significant improvements.


### How

The mission of PRIMA is nontrivial due to the delicacy of Powell's algorithms and the unique style
of his code. To ensure the faithfulness of PRIMA,
the **modern** Fortran version was started by refactoring Powell's code into the free form via a small
[MATLAB tool](./matlab/setup_tools/freeform.m).
However, such refactored code is far from what is desired, because it inherits completely
the structure and style of Powell's code except for the layout. Extensive modifications are needed
to reorganize (indeed, to **rewrite**) the code. To maintain the faithfulness and quality of the
reference implementation, extensive tests are conducted after each and every tiny modification,
using the [CUTEst](https://github.com/ralna/CUTEst) problems via [MatCUTEst](https://github.com/equipez/matcutest).
The tests do not only verify the faithfulness of the implementation but also check that **the solvers
behave properly even if they are invoked with improper inputs or encounter failures of function evaluations**.

The tests are automated by
[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions). As of March 2023, more than
35,000 "workflows" have been successfully run by GitHub Actions. Normally, each workflow consists of \~ 5
([sometimes more than 150](https://github.com/primalib/prima/actions/runs/4345972852))
**randomized** tests,
each test taking from tens of minutes to several hours (the maximum
is 6 hours, after which the workflow will be canceled automatically). In other words,
PRIMA has been verified by more than 150,000 hours (or **more than 15 years**) of randomized tests.

Since each GitHub Team account can only run at most 60 GitHub Actions workflows concurrently, I have
to distribute this large amount of tests to several different Team accounts as follows.

### Current status

- **Fortran**

    After almost **three** years of intensive coding, **the [modern Fortran version](./fortran) of
    PRIMA has been finished by December 2022.**

    Given the **modern** Fortran version, the implementation in other languages
    becomes **much easier**, because we now have a structured and modularized implementation as a reference.
    I will implement the methods in other languages in this way.

- **MATLAB**

    - An [interface](./matlab/interfaces/prima.m) is provided for [using the Fortran implementation under MATLAB](./README_mat.txt).
      Interfaces for other languages will be available later.
    - A [pure MATLAB version of NEWUOA](./matlab/interfaces/+newuoa_mat/) is implemented. It was
      generated straightforwardly (indeed, **automatically**) from an earlier version of the
      **modern** Fortran code (with the help of Mr. Galann Pennec).


### Bug fixes

PRIMA has fixed some **serious** issues in the **original Fortran 77 implementation** of Powell's methods.
Note that all of them are problems in the Fortran 77 code rather than flaws in the algorithms.

<!---[NLopt.jl](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/NLopt.jl), -->
The examples given below are bugs or requests sent to [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy),
[NLopt](https://github.com/stevengj/nlopt),
[nloptr](https://github.com/astamm/nloptr),
[OpenTURNS](https://github.com/openturns/openturns),
etc., which are reputable packages that wrap/interface the **original Fortran 77 implementation**
of Powell's solver. Inevitably, they suffer from the bugs in the Fortran 77 code.

- The Fortran 77 solvers may get **stuck** in infinite loops.

     - [Algorithm turns into infinite loop and never finishes #3](https://github.com/xypron/jcobyla/issues/3)

- The Fortran 77 solvers may **crash** with [segmentation faults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_fault)
  due to uninitialized variables that are used as indices.

	 - [Use of uninitialized variable in BOBYQA altmov #36](https://github.com/stevengj/nlopt/issues/36)

- Fortran 77 COBYLA may **not return the best point** that is evaluated; sometimes, the returned point can have a
large constraint violation even though the starting point is feasible.

### Improvements

Due to the improvements introduced into the new implementation, PRIMA outperforms Powell's
original code in terms of the **number of function evaluations**, which is the standard performance
indicator in derivative-free optimization.
Below are the [performance profiles](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0102001.pdf)
of the PRIMA solvers compared with Powell's implementation, the convergence tolerance being $\tau = 10^{-6}$.
Roughly speaking, performance profiles plot the percentage of test problems solved against the budget,
which is measured relative to the cost of the most efficient solver in the comparison.
A **higher** curve indicates a **better** solver.
See [Benchmarking Derivative-Free Optimization Algorithms](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~wild/dfo/benchmarking)
([J. J. Moré](https://www.anl.gov/profile/jorge-j-more) and [S. M. Wild](https://www.anl.gov/profile/stefan-m-wild))

### A "fun" fact

In the past years, while working on PRIMA, I have spotted a dozen of [bugs in reputable Fortran compilers](https://github.com/zequipe/test_compiler)
and two [bugs in MATLAB](https://github.com/zequipe/test_matlab). Each of them represents days of **bitter** debugging, which finally led to the conclusion
that it was not a problem in my code but a flaw in the Fortran compilers or in MATLAB. From a very unusual angle, this reflects how intensive
the coding has been.

The bitterness behind this "fun" fact is exactly why I work on PRIMA: I hope that all
the frustrations that I have experienced will not happen to any user of Powell's methods anymore.


### Acknowledgment

PRIMA is dedicated to the memory of the late [Professor Powell](https://www.zhangzk.net/powell.html) with gratitude for his inspiration and
for the wealth he left to us.

I am grateful to [Professor Ya-xiang Yuan](http://lsec.cc.ac.cn/~yyx) for his everlasting encouragement and support.

The development of PRIMA would have been a mission impossible without the groundwork laid by the [PDFO](https://www.pdfo.net)
package of [Tom M. Ragonneau](https://tomragonneau.com/) and Zaikun Zhang. PDFO is Chapter 3 of
Ragonneau's [thesis](https://tomragonneau.com/documents/thesis.pdf) co-supervised by Zaikun Zhang and Professor [Xiaojun Chen](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/staff/xjchen/ChenXJ.htm), with financial support from
the [Hong Kong Ph.D. Fellowship Scheme](https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/hkpfs/index.html) (ref. PF18-24698).

PRIMA is a long-term project, which would not have been sustainable without the continued funds from the
[Hong Kong Research Grants Council](https://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/rgc/) (ref. PolyU 253012/17P, PolyU 153054/20P,
and PolyU 153066/21P) and [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/) (PolyU),
